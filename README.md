# New Year auto-poster

This is a simple Python script to automatically post a "Happy New Year!" message to your Mastodon profile.

## PREREQUISITES

- You need to have your Mastodon instance, email and password ready to enter into the script. This information will be stored in a folder called "credentials" in the same directory as the script.

If it does then quit after, you just need to restart the script.
